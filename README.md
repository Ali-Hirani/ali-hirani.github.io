# My Personal Website

This site was created to showcase my projects and experience.
The site was constructed using the [Materialize CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/)
and many of its design elements were derived from [Google's Material Design Guidelines]
(http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). Find a screenshot 
of the site below.
